My repository of simple python scripts to automate certain tasks.

## [1. Mobile Number Extract from copied text of clipboard](https://github.com/danishdtp/pythonScripts/tree/0ed5b0cfab46950391e9a1b8b1c4727ff1768c2c/MergeTwoTablesFilterColumns)

## [2. Merge two tables and filter not matching values]()
This script merges two csv or xlsx table using left join. The script is used for analysing big csv files in the tune of 2 GB. The script creates index by joining two ids convert it into string and joins the table. The dataframe is then filtered to find not matching values. The script essentially works similar to spreadsheets index match or vlookup an automates the task.

## [3. Copy Tables from website into excel files multiple times](https://github.com/danishdtp/pythonScripts/tree/0ed5b0cfab46950391e9a1b8b1c4727ff1768c2c/copyTablesToExcelSheet)
This script simply copies the table from website into a specified excel file. It's useful for repetitive copy and paste. You just need to copy the table in browser and run this script specifying the excel file name where you want to append the table.

## [4. Auto SMS Script using Windows Phone Link](https://github.com/danishdtp/pythonScripts/tree/0ed5b0cfab46950391e9a1b8b1c4727ff1768c2c/autoSMSScript)
This script uses Windows Phone link app to send 100 SMS to a list of mobile number in xlsx file. The xlsx file containing Mobile Number and Message to be sent is to be supplied with the script, switch to the Phone link and done. The script will auto send the script.

## [5. Copy Bottom or Top 20 rows from copied text](https://github.com/danishdtp/pythonScripts/tree/0ed5b0cfab46950391e9a1b8b1c4727ff1768c2c/copyBottomTop20)

This script copies the ids from excel file and runs on website, then copies the output text and find 10 digit mobile number and pastes it back into excel file. It's pretty specific but ideas used in this are quite innovative.


## [7. Fetch 8 digit ID into excel](https://github.com/danishdtp/pythonScripts/tree/0ed5b0cfab46950391e9a1b8b1c4727ff1768c2c/fetchfamilyID)
