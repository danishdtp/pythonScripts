# Python Scripts to Automate Simple Tasks

My repository of simple python scripts to automate certain tasks.

## [1. Mobile Number Extract from copied text of clipboard](https://github.com/danishdtp/pythonScripts/tree/0ed5b0cfab46950391e9a1b8b1c4727ff1768c2c/MergeTwoTablesFilterColumns)
This script reads the copied text from clipboard, finds 10 digit mobile number and copies it back into the clipboard. Very useful for repetitive work where we need to find all mobile numbers in a text. The program is provided for windows as well as linux, to use this script 
  * Copy your text which contains mobile number
  * Now run the file mobileNumExtract.exe
  * The script will find all mobiles and copy them into clipboard.
  * Just paste extracted numbers anywhere you want
  The script runs instantly even with large text in clipboard
  A sample file is provided to test the script which contains 10 digit number along with expected result.
